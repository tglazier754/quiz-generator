## Quiz Generator

This project is a POC demonstration, written in React/TypeScript/Next of some technologies I wanted to work in. These include:
-AI
-API development
-Chakra UI
-Supabase Auth + Database
-Tesseract
-HTML-to-Text

## Capabilities + How to Use
The app revolves around the concept of resources. In order to generate a quiz, you must specify a resource to include.
A resource can be generated from a url, from copied/typed text or extracted from an image using the tesseract library.
Once at least one usable resource exists, you can generate a quiz or a lesson plan.

## Next Steps
-add ability to download content to a pdf file
-add testing
-unauthenticated user checks are buggy/missing
-UI updates
-Tighten up code
